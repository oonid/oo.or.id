Have you heard Duolingo English Test[^1] (DET)?
I suppose you've heard English tests like TOEFL, IELTS, or Cambridge English Exam.
Duolingo offers another English Test to certify your English proficiency. It's used by many companies or universities globally, and in my opinion, it's very efficient. You can take the test online without needing to adhere to a specific schedule. The test only takes about 1-2 hours, and in terms of the costs, it's affordable. The test has very strict rules and employes both Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human proctors.

Even in terms of pricing, the DET is affordable and has a unique pricing models. Two things that I remember are discount if you purchase the test twice at once and option to get the results faster (12 hours instead of the usual 48 hours) if you purchase for an extra voucher. 

DET also provides a score comparison with the other English tests[^2] (TOEFL, IELTS, and CEFR).

My experience with the Duolingo English Test has been quite positive since I hadn't taken TOEFL, IELTS, or similar tests before. In my first attempt, I scored 125, which falls within the B2 (Upper Intermediate) band. In my second attempt, I scored 130, slighty moving up to the C1 (Advanced) level. :joy: 
Yeah I know, I need to improve more on Production (writing and speaking) and Conversation (listening and speaking) scores.

Another great experience I had is that DET offers practice tests. After purchasing the voucher, you can take an unlimited number of practice tests :nerd:. The practice tests provide an instant range of predicted scores, which, from my point of view, are quite accurate.

So, are you interested to testing your English proficiency with DET? :thinking:
