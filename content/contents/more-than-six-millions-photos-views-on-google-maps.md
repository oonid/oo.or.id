It's been three years since my last post, with three millions views of my photos on Google Maps.

Now with 585 photos (increased 261), finally I doubled the total views of my photos on Google Maps, now it has more than six millions views.

Don't forget to [follow me](https://maps.app.goo.gl/prmGMtbD1AMGZ94T6) on Google Maps.

As you can see in the figure, my reviews on Google Maps also increasing.

Oh by the way, I can't post another exact millions views, since Google Maps did not send the celebration mail anymore. :cry:

Let's help people by sharing information to them, one photo at a time because a picture is worth a thousand words. :joy:
