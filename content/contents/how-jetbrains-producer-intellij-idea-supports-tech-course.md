I have a great experience of using Android Studio and also IntelliJ IDEA.

I told the Jetbrains team about my activities&nbsp;in tech education, I have course about introduction to Python programming languange and Cloud platform.

And they support me with their IntelliJ IDEA license!

Awesome, Jetbrains team!
