Best Wishes for the New Year!

Begin the year with fresh experiences. Cultivate the habit of indoor running, using a treadmill, of course. Just another sports resolution for the new year! :joy:

My treadmill is integrated with the [Zwift](https://zwift.com) app, and the screenshot above shows my workout activity recorded on Zwift in 2024.
Oh, by the way, I've connected [Strava](https://strava.com) to the Zwift app since my office competition uses Strava. The activities will automatically be saved to Strava when saved on Zwift.

The downside is that the run activity on Zwift will be synced as a **Virtual Run** on Strava. :confused:

Happy New Year! May it be filled with joy!
