Surah Ar-Rahman is often referred to as the "Bride of the Quran" due to its poetic beauty and the 31 times recurring refrain, "Then which of the favours of your Lord will you deny?" Its rhythmic structure and captivating verses have earned it this title. It is the 55th Surah, consisting of 78 ayahs.

RasoolAllah ﷺ  once said, "When I recite this Ayah in front of the Jinn, they start crying loudly and say, 'None of our Lord’s blessings do we deny.'"
