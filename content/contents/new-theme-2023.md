After years of not touching my blog, today I decided to rebuild with the new theme, [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). This is gonna be the theme of 2023! 
 
So happy with the Blowfish Hugo theme, it provides most of the features that I have been used. 
 
Not only a new theme, but this time I am trying to revive my writing spirit! :star_struck: 
 
Oh by the way, I also moved the site hosting from Firebase to Cloudflare[^1] :rocket:, it synchronizes (deployed) automatically when I push the updates on GitHub. 
 
I really can't wait to update the blog!
