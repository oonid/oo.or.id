If you search about **Jago** it could refer to Rooster (in bahasa Indonesia: Ayam Jago, Ayam Jantan), or it could be means **an expert** or even **a champ** (both also in bahasa Indonesia) [^1].

Anyway, here's my new inisiative, sharing about a great (python) web backend framework Django in Bahasa Indonesia, I call it: "**JagoDjango**".

I have started the development in my github repo: jagodjango [^2].

Every month I will update the contents with new Django Apps to support the Django community [^3] in Indonesia with a better web apps samples.
