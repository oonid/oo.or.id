It's been three years since my last post, with three million views of my photos on Google Maps.

Now with 585 photos (increased by 261), I have finally doubled the total views of my photos on Google Maps, now it has more than six million views.

Don't forget to [follow me](https://maps.app.goo.gl/prmGMtbD1AMGZ94T6) on Google Maps.

As you can see in the figure, my reviews on Google Maps also increasing.

Oh by the way, I can't post another exact million views, since Google Maps no longer sends the celebration email. :cry:

Let's help people by sharing information with them, one photo at a time, because a picture is worth a thousand words. :joy:
